# Databases Project

Use this repository for your integration code and any source code created while working on your project (ad-hoc code,
SQL queries, project files needed by external tools, etc.).

- Merge your code into the `main` branch on the due date. 
- __Do not__ commit datasets!
- Any other document (except for the dump in the final hand-in) should be handed-in via ADAM.

If you have any questions regarding the project, please do not hesitate to ask during the exercise lessons or via mail
to [luc.heitz@unibas.ch](mailto:luc.heitz@unibas.ch)!

It is recommended that you first create a ```.gitignore``` file. (And exclude the "datasets" folder, for example). A useful tool for creating ```.gitignore``` files is www.gitignore.io.

Replace this readme file with a short description of your project and your goals, as early as possible but no later than MS2 hand-in.
